### 1. Modules and Imports

```rust
mod multiset_operations;
mod set_operations;

use multiset_operations::MultiSet;
use set_operations::Set;
```

- `mod`: Declares a module. The actual code for the modules `multiset_operations` and `set_operations` is not shown, but they should be either in the same file or in `multiset_operations.rs` and `set_operations.rs` files respectively.
- `use`: Imports types or functions from a module into the current scope. Here, `MultiSet` and `Set` are imported.

### 2. Main Function

```rust
fn main() {
    // ...
}
```

- `fn`: Keyword to define a new function.
- `main`: The entry point of a Rust program.

### 3. Variable Declaration and Initialization

```rust
let a = Set::from_vec(vec![true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false, true, false]);
```

- `let`: Used for variable declaration.
- `Set::from_vec`: Calls a associated function (similar to a static method in other languages) named `from_vec` of the `Set` struct.

### 4. Mutable Variable Declaration

```rust
let mut a_mult = MultiSet::from_vec(vec![3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]);
```

- `mut`: Indicates that the variable is mutable, i.e., its value can be changed.

### 5. Array/Vector Indexing

```rust
a_mult.elements[0] = 3;
```

- Elements in a vector/array can be accessed using the index.

### 6. Printing to Console

```rust
println!("Set A:");
```

- `println!`: A macro (not a function) to print to the console with a newline at the end.

### 7. Method Calls on Structs

```rust
let not_a = a.complement();
```

- Methods are called on instances of structs using the dot notation.

### 8. Public Struct Declaration

```rust
pub struct Set {
    pub elements: Vec<bool>,
}
```

- `pub`: A visibility modifier that makes the struct and its fields public.
- `struct`: Keyword to define a new structure.
- `Vec<bool>`: A vector of boolean values.

### 9. Implementing Methods for a Struct

```rust
impl Set {
    // ...
}
```

- `impl`: Begins an implementation block for methods of a struct.

### 10. Function Definitions with Parameters

```rust
pub fn union(&self, other: &Set) -> Set {
    // ...
}
```

- `&self`: A reference to the current instance of the struct (similar to `this` in other languages).
- `other: &Set`: A reference to another `Set` instance.
- `-> Set`: Indicates the return type of the function.

### 11. Iterating Over Collections

```rust
for &element in &self.elements {
    // ...
}
```

- `for`: Begins a for loop.
- `&element`: Pattern matching to destructure and get the value from the reference.

### 12. Printing with Format Specifiers

```rust
println!("Sum of elements in A: {}", a_mult.sum());
```

- `{}`: A placeholder that will be replaced by the value specified after the format string.
